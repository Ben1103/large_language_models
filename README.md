# RAG Chatbot Project

Welcome to the RAG Chatbot Project repository! This project is designed to teach students about large language models (LLMs) through hands-on experience in building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. Utilising open-source models from Hugging Face, LangChain, and Streamlit, students will gain practical knowledge and skills in creating advanced conversational AI.

## About the Project

The RAG Chatbot Project was created for students of WBS Coding School. It serves as a comprehensive learning tool where students are encouraged to explore, experiment, and eventually create their own specialised chatbots. This project showcases the capabilities of modern LLMs and demonstrates how to leverage them for building sophisticated applications.

### Key Features

- **Hands-On Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks guide you through the process of building a RAG chatbot. These notebooks are designed to be run locally, with the possibility to operate entirely offline, provided you have the necessary hardware.
- **Open Source Tools**: Utilises popular open-source libraries and frameworks such as:
  - **Hugging Face**: For accessing pre-trained LLMs and other NLP tools.
  - **LangChain**: For managing the complex logic of language models and their interactions.
  - **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly interface for your chatbot.
- **Learning Objectives**: Gain a deep understanding of:
  - The history and evolution of large language models.
  - Fundamentals of deep learning.
  - Working with vector databases and their importance in modern AI applications.

### Learning Platform

While the interactive notebooks are a core component of this project, they are complemented by a comprehensive learning platform. This platform provides detailed information and resources on various topics such as the history of LLMs, deep learning principles, and vector databases. Note that the learning platform itself is not included in this repository but serves as an essential companion to the hands-on exercises.

### Encouraging Innovation

At WBS Coding School, students are not just passive learners but active creators. This project encourages you to take the foundational knowledge and skills gained here and innovate. Build your own specialised chatbot tailored to unique applications or industries, leveraging the power of what you have learned.

Happy coding, and enjoy your journey into the fascinating world of large language models!
